# Coding agent rules

Reusable instructions you can copy into your coding agent for everyday software development. They aim to reduce repeated prompting, avoidable mistakes, and time and tokens spent on rework.

Think of them as a reset for coding agents: safe defaults for doing the requested work, while your project still chooses its stack, architecture, conventions, and testing approach. They are written without depending on a particular coding agent or LLM model.

## Choose your rules

### [global-coding-agent-rules.md](global-coding-agent-rules.md)

Start here for any kind of software development project: websites, backend services, native applications, libraries, or command-line tools. Use it when starting a project or working in an established codebase.

It guides everyday work beyond writing code, including documentation, project research, tooling, and version control. The instructions ask the agent to stay within scope, protect existing work and sensitive data, get required approvals, check version-specific information, verify results, and explain blockers and next steps clearly.

### [web-development-rules.md](web-development-rules.md)

Add this for website and web application development, whether you work on a single HTML/CSS page, a server-rendered website, a multi-page application, or a JavaScript-rendered single-page application.

It adds web development defaults for native browser behaviour, layouts, accessibility, compatibility, web security, and testing the actual rendered result. It applies to web content and its supporting endpoints, including web interfaces embedded in native applications, without requiring a particular framework or rendering architecture.

**For web projects, use both `global-coding-agent-rules.md` and `web-development-rules.md` together.** Copy the contents of both into one agent instruction file. The web rules add to the global rules; the source files stay separate here only for maintenance.

You can still adapt or take selected sections to suit your workflow. Neither file replaces project-specific coding standards or specialist procedures; their scope is software-project work, not general-purpose assistant use.

Rules for additional operating systems and application runtime environments are planned.

## How to use

```text
Non-web project:
  global-coding-agent-rules.md ------------------> one agent instruction file

Web project:
  global-coding-agent-rules.md ----+
                                   +---------------> one agent instruction file
  web-development-rules.md --------+                  (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md,
                                                      or a Cursor rule)
```

1. **Choose where to use them.** Add them to your agent's user-level instructions for use across projects, or to a project's instruction file for that project only. "Global" describes the file's broad applicability; it does not require loading it for every project. For teams, keep shared instructions in version control so developers can use the same rules.
2. **Copy the content into one instruction file your agent reads.** This could be `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or a Cursor rule. For a web project, paste the contents of both source files into that same file, in either order. Keep headings, scope conditions, nested lists, and attached safety and approval conditions with the content.
3. **Merge with your existing rules.** Remove duplicates and resolve conflicts while preserving project requirements and safety boundaries. In mixed projects, apply the web rules only to web content and its supporting endpoints.
4. **Confirm the rules are loaded, then try them on a task.** Use your agent's available loading diagnostics to check that the complete content is included. Cloning this repository or copying these files into an arbitrary folder does not activate them. Adjust the selection if a rule adds friction without helping your work; use project checks to enforce mechanical requirements.

For placement details, see the official instructions for [Cursor](https://cursor.com/docs/rules), [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-md), [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory), or your chosen agent.

### Keep context relevant

When adapting these rules, distinguish guidance needed across tasks from guidance needed only for a project or activity:

- **Across tasks:** keep approval, privacy, work-preservation, verification, and communication boundaries in the instructions that are always loaded within your chosen scope.
- **For a project:** keep its tools, commands, conventions, and compatibility requirements in project instructions. Scope web development guidance to web projects or web-related areas of mixed projects using your agent's supported loading controls.
- **For an occasional task:** keep specialist procedures, such as full accessibility audits or performance profiling, in a task-specific reference or skill. Load them when relevant; keep basic safeguards and checks for affected behaviour in the baseline.

A conditional heading does not save context when the entire file is loaded. Do not move essential safety or approval boundaries solely into optional references.

Rules and skills can overlap; a different file type does not justify repeating the same instruction. Use relevant skills only when available and compatible with the project; otherwise consult official documentation. Using a skill does not authorise installations, upgrades, or unrelated changes.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome, including feedback from trying the rules in your own projects. Explain the problem your suggestion solves and whether it belongs in the global rules, web development rules, or project instructions.
